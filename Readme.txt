Manta Property Extension is a simple property handler extension for Windows Explorer that allows users (who are most probably developers) to see whether a Microsoft Portable Executable file like EXE and DLL is 32/64-bit architecture targeted, runs in CUI/GUI mode and other information within the Tooltip and Details pane of the file explorer. Besides this format, object files (.obj and .o) and library files (.lib and .a) are also supported.
